# Overview

This application is designed as a dashboard that provides users with a comprehensive overview of their business operations. To create this dashboard, I have utilized a variety of components that are commonly used in B2B applications, such as data grids, charts, and calendars. These components help to display complex data in an intuitive and easy-to-understand way, allowing users to quickly identify trends, make informed decisions, and take action. Overall, this application is a powerful tool for businesses to gain insights into their operations and improve their performance.

This is Instagram like application which is for portfolio and investigation not for release or monetize.

# PAGES

In the pages section, you can find tables that are used to list orders, employees, and customers. These tables are commonly used in dashboards and it is essential to display them distinctly. In addition, pagination is an important consideration when building these tables in case of a large amount of data that could potentially slow down the application.

# APPS

In the apps section of the application, I have developed several useful tools to enhance user experience, including a calendar, kanban board, editor, and color picker. These features provide users with greater control and flexibility when managing their tasks, schedules, and content. The calendar allows users to easily schedule and track events, while the kanban board provides a visual way to manage tasks and workflows. The editor tool helps users to create and edit rich content, and the color picker makes it easy to choose and apply colors to various elements throughout the application.

# CHARTS

The charts section of the application is where I have developed a range of visually stunning charts that help users to analyze data and identify trends quickly and easily. The charts include line, bar, and area charts, among others, each with its own unique set of features and benefits. The line chart, for example, is ideal for displaying data trends over time, while the bar chart is great for comparing data across different categories. The area chart can help to show data trends and patterns in a more intuitive way. These charts are designed to be both easy to read and customizable, allowing users to adjust settings such as color schemes, data labels, and axis labels to suit their needs.
